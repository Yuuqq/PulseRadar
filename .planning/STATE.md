# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-04-13)

**Core value:** Reduce technical debt without breaking any existing user-facing behavior — all CLI arguments, config.yaml files, and Docker deployments must continue working identically.
**Current focus:** Phase 02 — test-safety-net

## Current Position

Phase: 02 (test-safety-net) — EXECUTING
Plan: 2 of 7
Status: Ready to execute
Last activity: 2026-04-14

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Roadmap init: Tests ordered BEFORE decomposition (research flagged refactoring without safety net as highest-risk mistake)
- Roadmap init: TEST + COV requirements merged into one phase (Phase 2 "Test Safety Net") to match coarse granularity
- Roadmap init: Quality Gates deferred to Phase 4 to avoid lint noise during decomposition
- [Phase 02]: Set coverage ratchet to 27% (not 28%) because actual coverage is 27.93-27.99% and cov-fail-under requires total >= threshold

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- All phases must preserve CLI (`python -m trendradar`), config.yaml compatibility, Docker deployment, and public imports used by MCP server + Web UI — this is the hard constraint that shapes every plan
- Phase 3 open questions flagged by research: (a) `run_ai_analysis_fn` callback in notification_service.py re-triggers AI analysis and must be resolved during AnalysisEngine extraction; (b) `TrendAnalyzer.compare_periods()` output is computed but never used — confirm dead code vs. feature-in-progress before decomposition
- Phase 2 research gap: FastMCP 2.0 test client API is underdocumented; may need to test at handler/function level instead of MCP protocol level
